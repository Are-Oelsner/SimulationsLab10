Observations of the n = 9, 25, 49, 100, and 1000 experiment.



For each of the 95% confidence interval figures, list the number of “misses”,
i.e., the number of intervals that do not contain the true mean. Are your
counts consistent with the notion of 95% confidence?

  n     misses
  9     7
  25    7
  49    5
  100   3
  1000  6

  As the mean number of misses was 5.6 and only 5 trials were run I believe that
  number is close enough to 5 to be consistent with the notion of 95% confidence.



For the 90% and 99% confidence interval figures, list the number of misses. Are
your counts consistent with the notion of the level of confidence?

  CL    misses
  90%   14
  99%   1

  With 14 misses from the 90% confidence interval only differing from the
  expected number of 10 by 4, and 1 miss for the 99% confidence interval exactly
  reflecting our expected value of 1, I would say that these values are
  consistent with the expected valeues for the tested confidence levels.

Look closely at the 90% vs. 95% vs. 99% confidence interval figures for n = 25.
What do you notice about each of the corresponding confidence intervals from
figure to figure? Comment.

  As the variates were all generated from the same seed the variates for each
  trial are all the same, so the means all match it is only the length of the
  confidence interval that changes between each trial, with the confidence
  interval expanding as the confidence level increases, until only the 89th trial
  still does not reach the true mean.
